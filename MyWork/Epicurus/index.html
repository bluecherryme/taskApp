			<h4>His teachings</h4>
			<p> Epicurus appreciated the good things in life and encouraged his followers to focus on   	those, rather than dwell on problems, aches and misfortunes. The absence of evil is good.</p>

			<p>He held human friendships at high value as a source of generating happiness and satisfaction.</p> 

			<p>He did however not believe that happiness could be found in over-consumption of delicious foods, amorous love or drugs as that would eventually only lead to suffering.</p>  

			<p>He encouraged people not to fear death as he did not believe in life after death. One would not be aware of being dead and had therefore nothing to fear. </p>

		<h4>Quotes</h4>
		<img src="http://www.stockvault.net/data/2015/09/15/178245/small.jpg" alt="Coffee and Cookies">
		<p>"Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for."</p>

		<p>"It is not so much our friends' help that helps us as the confident knowledge that they will help us."</p>

		<p>"Not what we have but what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance."</p>

		<p>"Of all the things which wisdom provides to make us entirely happy, much the greatest is the possession of friendship."</p>

		<p>"You don't develope courage by being happy in your relationships everyday. You develop it by surviving difficult times and challenging adversity."</p>
